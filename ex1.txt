Libraries: (?)
	TensorFlow:
		An open-source library for Python, C, C++, Java, JavaScript. Swift, Go.
	PyTorch
		A Python package.

Applications:
	Handwriting recognition
		Feeding a dataset of different characters handwritten by people to develop an understanding of patterns in order to recognize a new set of handwriten characters.
	Image recognition
		Similar to handwriting
	Speech recognition
		Follows the same concept of picking up patterns in the given dataset. However, unlike image/handwriting, which have 2 spatial dimensions (placement of the pixels) and 0 time dimensions, speech recognition deals with 1 spatial (the sequence of words) and 1 time dimension (space between the words). This difference creates a more difficult approach.
	Face recognition (medical field)
		Used for spotting diseases and conditions
	Spell checking
